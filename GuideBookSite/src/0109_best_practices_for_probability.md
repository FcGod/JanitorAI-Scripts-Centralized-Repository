## 🟡 Best Practices for Probability

* ✅ Use probability for **flavor**, not for everything
* ✅ Keep rare events **special** (don’t hide key lore behind a 1% chance)
* ✅ Document your weights with comments so you remember why you picked them
* ❌ Don’t chain too many random checks at once — randomness piles up and makes scripts unpredictable in bad ways
