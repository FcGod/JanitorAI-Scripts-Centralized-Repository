# ðŸ“˜ Chapter 24: The Everything Lorebook (Modular Framework for People, Places, Traits & Events)

By now, youâ€™ve seen how lore entries can define people, places, relationships, and events. But when scripts start getting big, itâ€™s easy to get lost.

ðŸ‘‰ The **Everything Lorebook** is a way to **organize lore into categories** so you can keep it clear and expandable.

Think of it like a filing cabinet:

* One drawer for **people.**
* One for **places.**
* One for **traits.**
* One for **events.**
