## 🟡 Trick 3: Memory by Repetition

Scripts can also add reminders over time:

context.character.personality += ", has a good memory for conversation details";
context.character.scenario += " They remember important things the user has shared.";

Plain English:
Even if you don’t capture a name or hobby, you can add flavor text that says the bot “remembers.” This nudges the AI to act consistent with earlier lines.
