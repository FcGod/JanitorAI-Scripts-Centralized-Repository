# 📘 Chapter 21: Adaptive Reaction Engines (Polarity, Negation & Composite Moods)

So far, our reaction engines have been about **adding points** until a threshold is hit. That’s useful, but real emotions aren’t one-directional. People can:

* Feel positive **or** negative about a topic (**polarity**).
* Cancel out reactions if something is denied (**negation**).
* Hold **mixed feelings** (like bittersweet emotions).

👉 This is where adaptive engines shine: they calculate *direction* and *blend*, not just “on/off.”
