## ðŸŸ¡ Why Layer Lore?

* Keeps worlds **organized** but **alive.**
* Lets one keyword trigger **multiple categories** at once.
* Supports **growth over time** without spaghetti code.

Think of it like an orchestra:
*Definitional = instruments, Relational = harmonies, Event = percussion beats, Dynamic = changes in tempo.*
