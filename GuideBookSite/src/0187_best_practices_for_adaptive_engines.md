## 🟡 Best Practices for Adaptive Engines

* ✅ Use polarity when you want *direction* (love vs hate).
* ✅ Use negation so the bot doesn’t misread “not happy” as “happy.”
* ✅ Use composite moods for realism (bittersweet, conflicted).
* ❌ Don’t overload with giant wordlists — start small (3–5 words each).
