## 🟡 Key Takeaways from Chapter 8

* A **lorebook** is just a structured list of entries
* Each entry = keywords + personality + scenario
* Use **priorities** if multiple entries might trigger
* Start with flat if checks, move to arrays as your world grows
* Lorebooks keep scripts clean and organized — essential for big projects

✨ Pro Tip: Think of a lorebook like a **wiki inside your script**. Each entry is a “page” (a fact), and keywords are the links that lead to it.
