# ðŸ“˜ Chapter 14: Shifts & Conditional Layers

So far, our lore entries have been **flat**: one keyword â†’ one response. But real life isnâ€™t flat. A forest feels different at **day** vs. **night**. A character acts differently when theyâ€™re **calm** vs. **angry**.

ðŸ‘‰ Thatâ€™s where **shifts** (conditional layers) come in. They let one entry change flavor depending on extra context.
