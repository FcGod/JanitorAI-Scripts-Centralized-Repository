# ðŸ“˜ Chapter 3: The Sandbox Rules (What Works and What Doesnâ€™t)

If youâ€™ve ever played a video game in **sandbox mode**, you know you can experiment â€” but there are still boundaries. Thatâ€™s exactly what happens here.

Instead, it runs in a **safe sandbox** â€” a controlled runtime that now supports most **ES6 (modern JavaScript)** features **inside the sandbox scope**, while still blocking anything that touches global objects or external systems.
