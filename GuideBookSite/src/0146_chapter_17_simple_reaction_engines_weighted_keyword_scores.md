# 📘 Chapter 17: Simple Reaction Engines (Weighted Keyword Scores)

So far, your scripts have been **on/off switches**:

* If the user says “happy” → add cheerful personality
* If the user says “sad” → add somber personality

That’s good for basics, but what if you want your character to build up **stronger reactions** depending on *how many* related words show up?

👉 That’s what a **reaction engine** does: instead of a single trigger, it **scores words** and reacts based on the total.
