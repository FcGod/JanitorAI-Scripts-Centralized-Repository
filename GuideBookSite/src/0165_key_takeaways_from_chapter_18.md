## 🟢 Key Takeaways from Chapter 18

- You’re in a **modern ES6 sandbox**, not legacy ES5.
    
- Script size limit ≈ 300 KB — build big systems safely.
    
- Loops are virtually unlimited; just avoid infinite ones.
    
- Per-turn text additions should stay under ~600 characters.
    
- Still no async functions or external fetch calls.
    
- Use guards and `console.log()` for debugging.
    
- Performance issues today come from logic design, not sandbox ceilings.

✨ **Pro Tip:**  
You’re no longer writing “tiny, fragile scripts.”  
You’re building full systems — so write them like software: modular, readable, and maintainable.
