## ðŸŸ¡ Step 4: Flat Style (Beginner-Friendly)

If arrays feel overwhelming, you can just write entries as `if` checks.

if (padded.indexOf(" forest ") !== -1) {
context.character.personality += ", at home in nature";
context.character.scenario += "Tall trees sway in the breeze.";
}

if (padded.indexOf(" city ") !== -1) {
context.character.personality += ", sharp and streetwise";
context.character.scenario += "The streets buzz with activity.";
}

Plain English:
This works the same as a lorebook â€” itâ€™s just less organized. Fine for small scripts, but messy for big worlds.
