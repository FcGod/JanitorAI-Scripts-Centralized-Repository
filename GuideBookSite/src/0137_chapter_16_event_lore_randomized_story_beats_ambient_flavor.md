# ðŸ“˜ Chapter 16: Event Lore (Randomized Story Beats & Ambient Flavor)

Up until now, every script has been **user-driven**:

* The bot reacts to keywords
* The bot responds to message count

But what if sometimes *the world moves on its own*?

ðŸ‘‰ Thatâ€™s where **Event Lore** comes in. These are little **ambient events** â€” bells tolling, phones ringing, weather shifting â€” that fire on timers, random rolls, or story pacing. They add surprise and immersion, like background flavor in a movie scene.
