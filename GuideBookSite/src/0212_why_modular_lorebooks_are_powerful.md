## 🟡 Why Modular Lorebooks Are Powerful

* **Organization:** Keeps your entries neat and grouped.
* **Scalability:** Easy to expand — just add to the right category.
* **Flexibility:** You can apply different rules per category (e.g., probability for events, shifts for traits).
* **Reusability:** You can lift one category out (like “places”) and use it in another project.
