## 🟡 The Core Structure

Here’s the skeleton of an “Everything Lorebook”:

var lorebook = {
people: \[
{ keywords: \["damien", "godfather"], personality: ", calculating leader", scenario: "He sits in a lavish study." },
{ keywords: \["sophia"], personality: ", fiery and ambitious", scenario: "She moves with restless energy." }
],
places: \[
{ keywords: \["forest"], scenario: "Tall pines surround the clearing.", personality: ", grounded in nature" },
{ keywords: \["city"], scenario: "The streets bustle with life.", personality: ", sharp and streetwise" }
],
traits: \[
{ keywords: \["trust"], personality: ", cautious about trust" },
{ keywords: \["anger"], personality: ", prone to flashes of temper" }
],
events: \[
{ trigger: "count==10", scenario: "A church bell tolls in the distance." },
{ trigger: "count>20", scenario: "A storm begins brewing overhead." }
]
};

📖 **Plain English:**

* `people` → who the characters are.
* `places` → where things happen.
* `traits` → personality flags and behavior layers.
* `events` → timed or triggered story beats.
