# 📘 Foreword

This guide was written to help people who aren’t coders learn how to make scripts that bring their characters and worlds to life. For many, scripting feels like a mysterious wall of symbols and rules. My goal is to show you that it’s not magic — it’s just building blocks stacked carefully, one step at a time.

Whether you’re here to build roleplay characters, manage world lore, or just tinker for fun, I want this guide to be something you can flip through without feeling lost.

Remember: scripting is not about writing the “perfect” code. It’s about creating something that feels alive, fun, and responsive. Start small, experiment, and let your characters grow with you.
