## 🟡 Key Takeaways from Chapter 3

- You’re in a **sandbox-safe ES6 environment** — modern syntax works inside script scope.
    
- ✅ Safe: text tools, math, arrays, objects, regex, template literals, arrow functions.
    
- ⚠ Gray Area: padding, repeating, advanced regex, very large spreads.
    
- ❌ Blocked: async functions, timers, external calls, global access.
    
- Always favor **clarity + simplicity** — modern JS is available, but restraint keeps scripts fast and reliable.

Would you like me to apply this same **ES6-Sandbox modernization** style to Chapter 18 next (Performance & Sandbox Limits)?
