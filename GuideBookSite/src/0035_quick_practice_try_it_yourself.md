## 🟡 Quick Practice (Try It Yourself!)

1. Write a script that makes the character **sad** if the user types “sorry.”
2. Write a script that makes the character **excited** if the user says “let’s go!”
3. Write a script that makes the character **mysterious** if the user mentions “secret.”

(Hint: Use `indexOf(" sorry ")`, `indexOf(" let's go ")`, etc.)
