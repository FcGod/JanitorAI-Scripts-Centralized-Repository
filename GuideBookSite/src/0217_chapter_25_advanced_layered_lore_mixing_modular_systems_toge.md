# ðŸ“˜ Chapter 25: Advanced Layered Lore (Mixing Modular Systems Together)

At this point youâ€™ve seen:

* **Definitional lore** (facts about people, places, objects).
* **Relational lore** (connections, bonds, rivalries).
* **Event lore** (beats that fire on timing or triggers).
* **Dynamic lore** (entries that evolve with time or context).
* **The Everything Lorebook** (modular organization for people, places, traits, events).

ðŸ‘‰ Chapter 25 takes it further: showing how to **combine these systems** into one **layered engine**.
