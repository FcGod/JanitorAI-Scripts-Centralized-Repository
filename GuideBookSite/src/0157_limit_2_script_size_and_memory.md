## ðŸŸ¢ Limit 2: Script Size and Memory

The sandbox now allows scripts up to â‰ˆ **300 KB** of code â€” a massive leap from the old 25 KB limit.

You can build multi-layered systems, emotion engines, and full lorebooks in one file.  
Still, keep individual **string additions short** (â‰ˆ < 600 characters each) so outputs stay readable and never exceed per-turn message budgets.

**Guideline:**

- Short sentences = more stable outputs.
    
- Big scripts = fine. Big _replies_ = risky.
