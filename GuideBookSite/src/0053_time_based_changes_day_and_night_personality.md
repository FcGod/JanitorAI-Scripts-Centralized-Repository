## ðŸŸ¡ Time-Based Changes (Day and Night Personality)

Scripts can also read the clock! That means you can change how your character acts at night vs. day.

var hour = new Date().getHours();

if (hour < 6 || hour > 22) {
context.character.personality += ", a bit sleepy";
context.character.scenario += " Itâ€™s late at night, and everything feels quiet.";
} else {
context.character.personality += ", bright and energetic";
context.character.scenario += " Itâ€™s daytime, the world is busy around you.";
}

Plain English:

* If itâ€™s past 10 PM or before 6 AM â†’ character feels sleepy
* Otherwise â†’ character feels awake and lively

This makes conversations feel grounded in a *living world*.
