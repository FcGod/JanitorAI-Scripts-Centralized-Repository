## 🟡 Strategy 4: Lore Fusion

Two lore entries can combine into something new.

Example code:

if (padded.indexOf(" magic ") !== -1 && padded.indexOf(" forest ") !== -1) {
context.character.scenario += " The forest is alive with strange magical energy.\n\n";
}

📖 **Plain English:**

* Normally, “magic” and “forest” have separate notes.
* If both appear → they fuse into a **unique blended event.**
