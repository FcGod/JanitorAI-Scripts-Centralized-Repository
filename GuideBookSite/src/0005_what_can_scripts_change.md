## 🟡 What Can Scripts Change?

This is important: scripts only get to change **two things**:

1. **Personality** → how the character acts or feels

   * Example: “cheerful and supportive”

2. **Scenario** → what’s happening around the character

   * Example: “It’s late at night, and the rain is tapping on the window.”

Everything else (like the character’s name, memories, or chat history) is locked. The sandbox doesn’t let you mess with it. Think of **Personality** and **Scenario** as two whiteboards you’re allowed to write on.
