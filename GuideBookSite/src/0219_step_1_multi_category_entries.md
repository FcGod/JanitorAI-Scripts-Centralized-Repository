## 🟡 Step 1: Multi-Category Entries

Sometimes a single keyword belongs in multiple drawers. For example, “forest” is both a place and an emotional tone.

var lorebook = {
places: \[
{ keywords: \["forest"], scenario: "Tall trees sway in the wind." }
],
traits: \[
{ keywords: \["forest"], personality: ", grounded and calm" }
]
};

📖 **Plain English:**
Mentioning “forest” expands both scene and personality at once.
