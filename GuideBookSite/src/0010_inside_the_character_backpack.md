## 🟢 Inside the Character Backpack

The script gives you a special box called `context.character`.

Here’s what’s inside — some pieces are _read-only_, others are _editable_:

|Property|Meaning|Editable?|
|---|---|---|
|`name`|the character’s full name|❌|
|`chat_name`|their display name in chat|❌|
|`example_dialogs`|sample training lines|❌|
|**`personality`**|their mood, traits, and tone|✅|
|**`scenario`**|what’s happening around them|✅|

Plain English:

- `name` = their driver’s license — you can read it, not rewrite it.
    
- `chat_name` = their nametag in the play.
    
- `example_dialogs` = practice lines, hands off.
    
- `personality` = their inner mood — you can add to it mid-scene.
    
- `scenario` = the stage set — you can rearrange it safely.
