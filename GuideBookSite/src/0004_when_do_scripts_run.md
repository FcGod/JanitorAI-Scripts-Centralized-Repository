## 🟡 When Do Scripts Run?

Scripts are automatic. You don’t press a button to activate them. They run:

* Before every single bot reply.
* Right after the user sends a message.
* Every time the chat moves forward.

That means your script is always “listening,” watching what the user says, and adjusting the character’s behavior in the background.
