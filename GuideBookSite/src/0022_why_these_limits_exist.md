## ðŸŸ¡ Why These Limits Exist

The sandbox is designed to:

1. **Stay Fast** â€” Scripts run before every bot reply, so they must finish in milliseconds.
    
2. **Stay Safe** â€” No network, file, or global access.
    
3. **Stay Simple** â€” You get all core ES6 syntax without external complexity.
    

Think of it like a **practice car with upgraded controls but a speed limiter** â€” you can use all the modern conveniences, but you still canâ€™t crash through the walls.
