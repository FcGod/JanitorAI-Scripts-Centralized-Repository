## ðŸŸ¢ Rule 4: Favor Readable Logic Over Compression

The old 25 KB ceiling encouraged code-golf tricks.  
Now you can write descriptively:

```js
if (isEvening && isGreeting) {
  context.character.scenario += " The cafÃ© lights glow softly.";
}
```

Readable code beats dense one-liners every time.
