## 🟡 Trick 4: Hybrid Lore + Memory

You can combine lore with memory, so the bot responds differently based on what the user likes.

Example:

* If user says they like “stars,” and then mentions “magic,” the lore might be written with a positive spin:

  * “Magic feels harmonious, like a song from the stars.”

* If user dislikes “darkness,” the same lore shifts to caution:

  * “Magic can be dangerous, especially when tied to shadows.”

Plain English:
This makes the world feel **tailored** to the user, like the character is really paying attention.
