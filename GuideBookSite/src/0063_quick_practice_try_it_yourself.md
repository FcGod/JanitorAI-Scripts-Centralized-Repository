## 🟡 Quick Practice (Try It Yourself!)

1. Make the bot **remember a favorite color** if the user says “I like blue.”
2. Make the bot **avoid scary topics** if the user says “I’m afraid of spiders.”
3. Make the bot **store a pet’s name** if the user says “My dog’s name is Max.”

(Hint: use the same pattern as the “my name is” example, but change the word.)
