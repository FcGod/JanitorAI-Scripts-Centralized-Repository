var lorebook = \[
{ keywords: \["forest"], personality: ", at home in nature", scenario: "Tall trees sway in the breeze." },
{ keywords: \["city"], personality: ", sharp and streetwise", scenario: "The streets buzz with activity." },
{ keywords: \["river"], personality: ", calm and reflective", scenario: "Water flows gently nearby." }
];

Plain English:
Now “forest,” “city,” and “river” each unlock their own lore.
