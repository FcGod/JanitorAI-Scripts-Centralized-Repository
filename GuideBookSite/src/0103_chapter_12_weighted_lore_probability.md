# 📘 Chapter 12: Weighted Lore & Probability

Up until now, your scripts have been **deterministic** — meaning: if the user types a word, the script *always* triggers the same response. That’s great for consistency, but it can feel predictable.

What if sometimes the bot shares a story, but other times it stays quiet?
What if mentioning “magic” doesn’t always flood the scene with spell lore?

👉 That’s where **weights and probability** come in.
