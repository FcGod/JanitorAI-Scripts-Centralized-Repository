# 📘 Appendix D: Practice Challenges

1. Make a lore entry for “ocean” that shifts between calm (day) and stormy (night).
2. Build a simple polarity engine for trust vs. doubt.
3. Add an event that fires at 15 messages: “a knock at the door.”
4. Write a hybrid mood for happy + tired = “content but yawning.”

> Bonus: Add a 10% chance per message for a tiny ambient event (e.g., “distant footsteps”) and see how often it feels right vs. too frequent.
