# ðŸ“˜ Chapter 22: Hybrid Emotional States (Blending Multiple Engines)

So far, weâ€™ve built:

* **Simple engines** (counting words = reaction).
* **Adaptive engines** (positive vs negative, negation, composite moods).

But people donâ€™t just feel *one* thing at once.
ðŸ‘‰ You can be **nervous AND excited.**
ðŸ‘‰ You can be **angry AND affectionate.**

This is where **hybrid emotional states** come in: combining multiple engines to calculate a *blend*.
