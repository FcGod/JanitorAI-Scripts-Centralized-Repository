* ✅ Use **message count** to stage lore progression.
* ✅ Upgrade traits instead of just stacking new ones.
* ✅ Unlock new entries gradually for pacing.
* ✅ Fuse multiple keywords for surprising combos.
* ✅ Add probability for variety.
* ❌ Don’t make every entry dynamic — keep some static for stability.
