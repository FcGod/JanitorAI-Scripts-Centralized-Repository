## ğŸŸ¢ Limit 7: Randomness & Variation

`Math.random()` works normally.  
You can safely randomize lines, choose probabilities, or mix personality shifts.

```js
if (Math.random() < 0.3) {
  context.character.personality += ", unexpectedly playful";
}
```

Use randomness for color, not for crucial logic that the story depends on.
