## 🟡 Putting It All Together

Dynamic behaviors make your character:

* **Evolve over time** (message count)
* **Feel tied to the world** (day/night cycles)
* **Experience surprises** (events at milestones)
* **Reveal secrets naturally** (timed keyword gates)

Even if you never touch “advanced lorebooks,” just adding **message count + time-based + event triggers** can make your bot feel much richer.
