## 🟡 Type 1: Definitional Lore

**What it is:**

* Baseline facts about people, places, or objects.
* Things that don’t change often.

**Examples:**

* “The Godfather is calculating and charismatic.”
* “The forest is filled with tall pines.”

Example code:

if (padded.indexOf(" godfather ") !== -1) {
context.character.personality += ", calculating and charismatic.\n\n";
context.character.scenario    += "He sits in a lavish study.\n\n";
}

📖 **Plain English:**
Definitional lore tells us *what exists.*
