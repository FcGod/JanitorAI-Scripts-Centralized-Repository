# ðŸ“˜ Chapter 2: The Context Object

When your script runs, it doesnâ€™t start from scratch â€” itâ€™s handed a **context object**.  
Think of the **context** like a backpack your script always carries. Inside, youâ€™ll find everything you need to know about:

- **The character** â€“ their personality, scenario, and traits.
    
- **The chat** â€“ what the user said, how long the talk has gone, and (optionally) a few of the latest messages.
