# ðŸ“˜ Introduction

Welcome to the **Script Making Guide**, a beginner-to-advanced handbook for writing scripts in a sandbox environment.

This book starts at the absolute basics:

* What a script is.
* How it interacts with personality and scenario.
* Simple keyword checks.

Then it builds steadily into intermediate and advanced topics:

* Lore structures.
* Probability and randomization.
* Message count gating.
* Reaction engines.
* Emotional hybrids.
* Modular frameworks like the **Everything Lorebook.**

By the time you finish, youâ€™ll know how to:

* Write safe scripts that wonâ€™t crash.
* Make conversations feel dynamic and immersive.
* Organize large worlds into neat, reusable modules.

The only requirement? Curiosity. If you can read and follow examples step-by-step, you can script.

This guide has been written by **Icehellionx**, and shaped through weeks of testing, trial, and improvement. Every example, every snippet, has been verified to work in the sandbox environment described.

Think of this book as your roadmap: start at Chapter 1, take it one step at a time, and by Chapter 25 youâ€™ll be building full lore engines of your own.
