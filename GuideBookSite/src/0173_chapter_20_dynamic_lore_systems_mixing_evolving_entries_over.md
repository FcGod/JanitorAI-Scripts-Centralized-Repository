# ðŸ“˜ Chapter 20: Dynamic Lore Systems (Mixing & Evolving Entries Over Time)

Up until now, your lore entries have been **static**:

* If a word shows up â†’ add this personality/scene.
* If message count hits 10 â†’ fire this event.

Thatâ€™s good, but static lore can feel predictable. A **dynamic lore system** lets entries:

* Change depending on *when* they fire.
* Build on each other in stages.
* Unlock or replace previous notes with new ones.

ðŸ‘‰ Think of it like a TV show: characters, relationships, and events **evolve** as the episodes go on.
