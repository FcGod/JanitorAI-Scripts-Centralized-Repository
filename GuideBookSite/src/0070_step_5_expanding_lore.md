## 🟡 Step 5: Expanding Lore

Lorebooks can include more than just traits and places. You can add:

* **Relationships** (e.g., “brother,” “mentor”)
* **Objects** (e.g., “sword,” “ring”)
* **Factions** (e.g., “mages guild,” “alchemists”)

Example:

var lorebook = \[
{ keywords: \["mentor"], personality: ", wise and strict", scenario: "Their mentor watches closely." },
{ keywords: \["ring"], scenario: "A mysterious ring glints faintly." }
];

Plain English:
Anything you want the bot to “know about” can go into a lorebook.
