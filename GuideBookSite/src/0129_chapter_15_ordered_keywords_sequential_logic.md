# 📘 Chapter 15: Ordered Keywords (Sequential Logic)

So far, your triggers have been simple:

* “happy” → add cheerful trait
* “forest” → add forest scene

But what if you only want something to fire if **keywords appear in order**?

👉 Example: “She teases you… then admits her feelings.”

* If the user only says “tease,” it shouldn’t fire
* If they only say “feelings,” it shouldn’t fire
* But if “tease” comes **before** “feelings,” it unlocks a special event

This is called **sequential logic.**
