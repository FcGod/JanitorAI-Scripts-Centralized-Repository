# ðŸ“˜ Chapter 8: Building a Simple Lorebook

Up until now, youâ€™ve been working with **triggers**: single words â†’ single responses. Thatâ€™s fine for small scripts, but what if you want your bot to *remember multiple pieces of world information*?

* Who someone is
* What a place looks like
* How a character reacts
