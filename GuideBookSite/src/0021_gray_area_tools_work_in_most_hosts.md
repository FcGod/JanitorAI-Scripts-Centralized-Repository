## ðŸŸ¡ Gray-Area Tools (Work in Most Hosts)

These features are usually fine but may behave inconsistently depending on implementation:

- `.padStart()` / `.padEnd()`
    
- `.repeat()`
    
- Advanced regex flags (`/s`, look-behind, named groups)
    
- Spread syntax on extremely large arrays (`...bigArray`)
    

âš  **Tip:** If you need absolute reliability, test your script once in the sandbox console before shipping.
