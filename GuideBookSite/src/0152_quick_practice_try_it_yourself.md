## 🟡 Quick Practice (Try It Yourself!)

1. Make a reaction engine for **anger words** (angry, furious, rage).

   * 1 = mild annoyance, 2 = frustration, 3+ = full rage
2. Build a **flirtation engine** where playful words (“wink,” “tease,” “smirk”) add up until the bot becomes overtly flirty
3. Create a **fear engine** where words like “dark,” “scary,” and “danger” escalate tension in the scenario
