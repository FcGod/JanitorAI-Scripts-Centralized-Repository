# 📘 Chapter 1: What Scripts Are

Imagine your character is like an actor in a play. Normally, they follow the script you wrote in their **Personality** and **Scenario** fields. But what if you wanted them to change their lines on the fly depending on what the user says? That’s where **scripts** come in.

A **script** is just a tiny set of instructions you write in a very basic form of JavaScript. Think of it like a recipe card:

* If this happens → do that.
* If the user says “hello” → make the character smile.
