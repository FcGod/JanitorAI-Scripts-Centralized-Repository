# ðŸ“˜ Chapter 19: Definitional vs. Relational vs. Event Lore

Not all lore entries serve the same purpose. Some define **what things are**, some explain **how they connect**, and some move the story with **what happens.**

ðŸ‘‰ Think of it like writing a play:

* **Definitional lore** = the stage and cast list.
* **Relational lore** = how the cast feels about each other.
* **Event lore** = the script that makes things happen.
