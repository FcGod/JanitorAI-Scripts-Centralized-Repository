## ðŸŸ¡ Why Use Probability?

Humans arenâ€™t machines â€” we donâ€™t always react the same way every time. By adding probability, you can make responses feel:

* **Fresh** â†’ The same word doesnâ€™t always trigger
* **Unpredictable** â†’ Surprises keep the conversation alive
* **Natural** â†’ Sometimes people mention something but donâ€™t elaborate
