# ðŸ“˜ Chapter 13: Min/Max Message Gating (Unlocking Content Over Time)

So far, weâ€™ve used **message count** for gradual shifts (polite â†’ casual â†’ trusting). But what if you want to **lock and unlock certain lore** depending on how long the conversation has been going?

Thatâ€™s what **min/max gating** is for. Itâ€™s like setting a **window of opportunity**:

* *Before 15 messages â†’ the secret is hidden*
* *Between 16â€“30 messages â†’ the secret is revealed*

ðŸ‘‰ This creates natural pacing, like chapters in a story.
