## 🟡 Step 4: Emotional Shifts

Shifts don’t have to be time-based — they can be **emotional layers**.

var lorebook = \[
{
keywords: \["mentor"],
personality: ", wise and strict",
shifts: \[
{ keywords: \["trust"], personality: ", softens when trusted" },
{ keywords: \["anger"], personality: ", harsh when angry" }
]
}
];

Plain English:

* “Mentor” = wise and strict
* If “trust” is present → add soft trait
* If “anger” is present → add harsh trait
