- They only change _personality_ and _scenario_.
    
- You can safely match words and phrases.
    
- You can also look back through **several recent messages** using `lastMessages`.
    

Now letâ€™s stack those building blocks into **progressive examples** â€” each one more advanced than the last.  
Think of it like leveling up in a video game: start at Level 1 (simple trigger) and end at Level 10 (dynamic lorebook).
