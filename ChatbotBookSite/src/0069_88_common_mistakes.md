## 8.8 Common Mistakes
Even experienced creators slip into patterns that weaken their bot cards. These mistakes usually come from treating the card like a profile sheet instead of a marketing hook. A bot card is not where you prove you know every detail of your character — it is where you **sell the click**.  

### 1. Titles That Don’t Hook
- **Weak:** “Sarah Johnson”  
- **Strong:** “Your Chaotic Roommate”  
Why it matters: A name alone doesn’t carry emotion. Titles should be short, punchy, and emotionally loaded. Save the character’s name for the subtitle.  

### 2. Blurbs That Read Like Biographies
- **Weak:** “Sarah is 22, from Ohio, and likes pizza.”  
- **Strong:** “Sarah eats cold pizza at 3 A.M., smirking like she knows you’re judging.”  
Why it matters: Biographies state facts. Teasers create scenes. Readers want to imagine the dynamic, not your census data.  

### 3. Random or Mismatched Images
- Portrait in anime style, banner in photorealistic style, supporting image as a blurry selfie.  
- Creates visual dissonance and breaks immersion.  
**Fix:** Pick 1–2 styles and stay consistent across portrait and supporting shots.  

### 4. Forgetting the Impact Line
Skimmers rarely read the full blurb. A bold pull-quote or one-liner (“Just don’t call her jealous.”) is essential. Without it, your card lacks a punch.  

### 5. Lore Dumps in the Blurb
- **Weak:** “The Kingdom of Aranor was founded in 1273 after the War of Iron…”  
- **Strong:** “Raised in noble tradition, she speaks stiffly in public but melts in private.”  
Why it matters: Worldbuilding belongs in Scenario, not the blurb. Cards must stay lean and emotional.  

### Design Lesson
The bot card is a **cover, not a manual.** Think in terms of **hooks, not history.** The fewer mistakes you make here, the more likely your bot gets tried in the first place.
