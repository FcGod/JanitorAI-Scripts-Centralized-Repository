## 6.6 Key Takeaways

- **Example Dialogue is training, not story.** Think of it as rehearsal footage — short clips that show the model how to act.  
- **Formatting must be consistent.** Italics for actions, quotes for speech, brackets for thoughts — whatever rules you choose, use them everywhere.  
- **Pacing is part of the lesson.** Mix short/snappy lines with longer, immersive beats so the bot learns rhythm control.  
- **Cover a range of emotional states.** Neutral, playful, intimate, tense, and repair give the model enough variety to feel alive.  
- **Keep it lean.** 3–6 examples are usually enough. More isn’t better if it bloats the token budget.  
- **Reinforce triggers.** Whenever possible, tie examples to cause-and-effect (praise → flustered, apology → repair). This makes the dialogue directly usable in play.  

**Design lesson:** Treat Example Dialogue like *flashcards.* Each clip demonstrates a specific interaction pattern. Together, they form a playbook that keeps the bot’s voice consistent, dynamic, and believable across long sessions.
