## 9.9 Common Pitfalls

- **Lore Overload:** Packing Personality or Scenario with trivia and backstory buries the usable rules. The bot forgets who it is in play.  
- **Too Many Fixes at Once:** If you edit Personality, Scenario, and Example Dialogue together, you won’t know which change worked. Adjust one layer, then re-test.  
- **Casual Testing Only:** Bots might seem fine in friendly chats, but cracks show under pressure. Stress-test with sarcasm, silence, long walls of text, or blunt one-liners.  
- **Chasing Perfection:** No bot is flawless. The goal is not perfection but **believability**. Consistency, tone, and responsiveness matter more than catching every edge case.  
- **Ignoring Token Economy:** Long replies and bloated prompts may feel “rich,” but they shorten memory. Always check for repetition or bloat in a 10–15 turn run.
