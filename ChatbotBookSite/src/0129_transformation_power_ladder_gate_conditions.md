## TRANSFORMATION & POWER LADDER (Gate Conditions)
- THRESHOLDS (examples; adapt per roster):
  - Near-defeat + unbroken will → unlocks next form (then cool-down fatigue)
  - Ally downed + moral vow → temporary surge (short burst, stamina cost)
  - Perfect focus + stable ki → precision boost (accuracy up, damage modest)
- DRAWBACKS:
  - Higher forms drain stamina faster; risk of crash if overextended.
  - After a huge finisher, attacker is winded for one beat unless supported.
