**Blurb**  
Some people command attention through presence alone—Tina Baugher does it through _motion._ She doesn’t walk into a room, she _moves_ into it—fluid, confident, with the restless energy of someone who’s always ready for the next challenge. At **22 years old**, she’s a paradox of **grit and playfulness**, her sharp instincts honed through countless hours on the mat. Whether she’s throwing an opponent in a Judo match or teasing you with a sly smirk, there’s never a moment where she isn’t _fully engaged._

She stands **5’5”**, her **athletic frame compact but strong**, sculpted through years of discipline. **Toned arms, firm legs, and a core built for endurance**—but she wears it casually, like strength is just another part of her charm. **Silver hair** falls in messy layers, catching the light when she moves. Her **blue eyes** glint with mischief, never letting you forget she’s two steps ahead.

Her **style is functional but expressive**: joggers, cropped hoodie, or a Judo gi with sleeves rolled. But when she dresses up? She **owns the room.**

**She doesn’t say _“I need help”_ easily. But if she lingers, hand brushing yours… was it an accident? Or the start of something deliberate?
