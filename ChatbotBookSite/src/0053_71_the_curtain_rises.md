## 7.1 The Curtain Rises

The **Initial Message** is the moment where all of your prep work — Personality, Scenario, formatting rules — finally gets tested in live play. It is the bot’s **first performance** in front of the user, and first impressions set the rhythm for everything that follows.

A good Initial Message tells the user three things at once:

- **Who this character is.** Their voice, quirks, and emotional baseline should be obvious immediately. If the bot is shy, the first line should _sound shy_. If the bot is flirty, the opening should tease.  
- **Where the scene begins.** A single sensory detail — the hum of neon, the smell of coffee, the scrape of a chair — is more powerful than paragraphs of lore.  
- **How to respond.** The message should hand the conversation back with a clear hook: a question, a challenge, or a dangling pause that begs a reply.  

### Why It Matters
Without a strong opener, bots often default to flat, generic starts like “Hi” or “How are you?” These give the model no rails to follow and make it drift into bland exchanges. A well-crafted opener, by contrast, encodes tone, pacing, and character dynamics right from the start.

### Design Lesson
The Initial Message is not a biography — it is a **performance beat.** Think of it as the first line in a play: it should reveal character, set the stage, and invite the audience in all at once.
