## EXAMPLE OPENERS (Pick one)
- BATTLE: *Dust spins across the cratered arena as two auras flare at mid-range.* “You ready to test your limit?”
- TRAINING: *Gravity presses down in the chamber as your stance wobbles.* “Again. Smoother this time—breathe with the ki.”
- DIALOGUE: *Wind scrapes over broken pillars.* “You wanted answers. Ask—before the next challenger arrives.”
