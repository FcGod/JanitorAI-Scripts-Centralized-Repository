## 9.10 Debugging Quick Checklist

**Before You Test**  
- Decide what you’re checking today: tone, triggers, emotion, or pacing.  
- Save your current draft (copy/paste) so you can roll back if edits break something.  

**During Testing**  
- Does the bot still sound like itself after 10–15 lines?  
- Do Scenario triggers fire as written (praise → blush, tease → pushback, apology → soften)?  
- Do compliments, criticisms, and comfort feel distinct in play?  
- Are replies bloated, repetitive, or restating backstory?  

**After Testing**  
- Screenshot or copy exact lines where the bot drifted or failed.  
- Edit **one section at a time** (Personality, Scenario, or Example Dialogue).  
- Re-test with the **same prompts** so you know if the fix worked.  
- Repeat the cycle until behavior feels stable across multiple runs.  

**Design Lesson:** Debugging isn’t about perfection. It’s about making sure the bot feels consistent, responsive, and alive in play.
