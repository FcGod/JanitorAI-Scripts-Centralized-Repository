## 14.2 Personality vs. Scenario Revisited

In scenario builds, the two permanent fields take on specialized jobs:

- **Personality → Controller Block.**  
    Defines the _narrator voice_ and _formatting rules._ It sets the world’s “presentation contract”: how narration looks, how tone stays consistent, how actions and dialogue are written.
    
- **Scenario → Simulation Engine.**  
    Defines the _present moment_ and the _rules of play._ It sets anchors for the current scene, emotional baseline, and functional “if–then” logic. It is **replaceable** between arcs (training → event → downtime → next arc) while the Controller remains fixed.
    

Think: **Controller = how the world talks.**  
**Scenario = what the world does right now.**
