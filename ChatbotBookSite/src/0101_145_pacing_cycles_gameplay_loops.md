## 14.5 Pacing Cycles & Gameplay Loops

Without cycles, scenario bots collapse: the user acts once, the scene ends. With cycles, tension builds, peaks, and resets.

### Core Principles

- **User Options:** Offer 2–4 meaningful next moves after each beat.
    
- **Narrative Feedback:** Show impact (environmental changes, power dips, NPC reactions).
    
- **Alternation:** High-intensity loops alternate with recovery or downtime.
    

### Cycle Types

- **Combat Cycle:** Training → Sparring → Event → Recovery.
    
- **Racing Cycle (Uma Musume):** Prep → Race → Recovery → Slice-of-life.
    
- **Romantic Cycle:** Tease → Escalation → Tension → Apology → Repair.
