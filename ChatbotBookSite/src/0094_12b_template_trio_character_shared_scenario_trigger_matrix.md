### **How to Use These Templates**

1. **Fill every slot with _contrasts._** Never let two characters react the same way to the same trigger.
    
2. **Use sensory anchors.** (Blush, smirk, fold arms, soften voice). These are cues the LLM reproduces well.
    
3. **Keep rules crisp.** One sentence per reaction is enough. Example: _“Claire blushes, fiddling with her necklace.”_
    
4. **Balance escalation and repair.** Every conflict path needs a way back to neutral, or the bot spirals into negativity.
    
5. **Stay within ~500–800 tokens.** These matrices should be lean enough to leave room for chat history.
