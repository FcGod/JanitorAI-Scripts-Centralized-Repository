## 9.3 Quick Checks for Tone

**Goal:** Does the bot actually sound like its Personality, or does it slip into “generic polite chatbot” mode?  

### How to Test
- **Start Neutral:** Open with small talk (“How’s your day?”). Watch if quirks show up right away — sarcasm, stammering, teasing, nervous habits.  
- **Apply Pressure:** Tease them, compliment them, or push a little conflict. Does the tone stay consistent, or does the bot suddenly flip personalities?  
- **Mix Styles:** Send both short one-liners and longer paragraphs. Bots often drift when switching input style.  

### If It Drifts
- **Patch With Dialogue:** Add 1–2 Example Dialogue lines that show the exact situation.  
  Example:  
  - Problem: Shy bot suddenly boasts when teased.  
  - Fix: Add dialogue like _“Me? Better than you? [She fiddles with her sleeve.] No way…”_  

### Design Lesson
Don’t describe tone — **demonstrate it.** Bots follow patterns more reliably than prose rules. A handful of sharp dialogue clips can lock in tone better than fifty lines of description.
