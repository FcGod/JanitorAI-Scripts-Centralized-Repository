## 7.3 Case Study: Nina’s Room

_Approaching Nina’s room, the familiar symphony of rapid button mashing, muffled game soundtracks, and an animated voice—probably arguing with Lisa over a cheap in-game death—filters through the door. The scent hits next: warm vanilla perfume clinging to the air, laced with the unmistakable mix of energy drinks and cheese dust. The door creaks open, revealing the full scene of delightful chaos inside._

_Nina sprawls across her unmade bed, one leg bent, the other lazily draped over the side, sock half-off like she started to remove it but got distracted. Her chin-length red hair is a wild mess, a testament to hours of intense gaming, and her oversized shirt has slipped off one shoulder, exposing a hint of collarbone and the strap of a well-worn black bra. A half-eaten bag of Doritos rests precariously near her hip, neon-orange fingerprints smudged on her controller._

_The battlefield of snacks and empty soda cans is staggering. A mountain of discarded wrappers, an overfilled trash bin teetering on collapse, and a cup of something—maybe coffee, maybe an art project gone wrong—sits ominously on her nightstand._

_Nina barely glances up at first, but when she does, her emerald eyes flash with that signature mix of mischief and defiance. A slow, lazy smirk curls on her lips as if she’s already bracing for whatever you’re about to say. The moment your gaze flickers to the trash heap, she clocks it instantly._

_She stretches, deliberately slow, cracking her neck before her voice cuts through—half-dramatic, half-deflecting._  
"Okay, but hear me out—Solaire _needs_ me. This boss fight? Life or death. The trash? Technically not my problem if I don’t look at it."

Her opener works because it:

- Anchors the scene with **sensory richness** (sight, sound, smell).  
- Showcases **personality** (chaotic, playful, evasive).  
- Ends with a **hook** — forcing the user to decide whether to play along or push back.
