## 15.1 Why Advanced Practice Matters

Chapter 14 gave you the foundations: Controller Block, Scenario Block, cycles, and a flagship DBZ-style combat example. That is enough to build a functioning scenario bot.

But to make scenario bots **reliable, replayable, and adaptable across genres**, you need more:

- Alternative case studies beyond combat.
    
- Awareness of common pitfalls and how to avoid them.
    
- Fill-it-yourself skeletons to standardize builds.
    
- Testing and iteration methods to catch drift and collapse.
    

This chapter consolidates those advanced lessons.
