## 14.6 Advanced Behavioral Logic (Part I)

Scenario bots rely on simple but explicit **engines**:

**Choice Engine** – Defines verbs the world recognizes. (Power Up, Guard, Taunt, Comfort; or Study, Socialize, Rest).  
**Consequence Engine** – Ties each verb to state change + feedback. (“Taunt → opponent hesitates; respect dips.”)  
**Tone Guide** – Encodes how narration changes with context (combat sharp and clipped; recovery slower, breath-focused).

Where to store rules:

- **Controller = style + formatting (always on).**
    
- **Scenario = live rules (often swapped).**
