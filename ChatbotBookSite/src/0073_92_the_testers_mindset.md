## 9.2 The Tester’s Mindset

Testing isn’t casual roleplay. You’re not just “having a chat” — you’re **poking at the design to see if it holds.** Think of yourself as both player and stress-tester.
### Core Habits
- **Set a Goal:** Go into each session with a focus.  
  Examples: “Today I’m checking tone,” “Does teasing trigger right?” or “Do repair rules actually soften conflict?”  

- **Try Extremes:** Don’t only play nice. Be playful, sarcastic, blunt, distant, or give one-word answers. See if the bot adapts or collapses.  

- **Keep Receipts:** Save a couple screenshots or copy-paste short snippets when something breaks tone. You don’t need full transcripts — just enough to remind yourself what went wrong.  

- **Change One Thing at a Time:** If you tweak both Personality and Scenario in the same edit, you’ll never know which fix helped. Adjust a single section, then re-test with the same inputs.  

### Design Lesson
Testing is about **stress, not comfort.** If you only test by chatting the way you expect to, you’ll miss the cracks. Push the bot into weird or difficult situations — that’s where design flaws reveal themselves.
