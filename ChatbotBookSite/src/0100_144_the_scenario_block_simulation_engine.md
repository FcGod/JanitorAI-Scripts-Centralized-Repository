## 14.4 The Scenario Block (Simulation Engine)

The Scenario Block is where the **simulation actually runs.** It anchors the present scene, sets the emotional baseline, and defines cause-and-effect rules. Unlike the Controller, it is **disposable and replaceable** — swap it as arcs shift, while keeping the narrator stable.

### What Goes Here

- **Scene Anchor:** Where you are, what it feels like, what’s at stake right now.
    
- **Relationship Baseline:** Current emotional state (rivals, uneasy allies, guarded attraction).
    
- **Functional Rules:** Crisp “if–then” cause-effect logic for combat, social tension, affection, escalation, and repair.
    

### Good Example – Training Arc Scenario

SCENARIO BLOCK:  
Scene: Barren wasteland under orange sky; dry wind tears at the plateau. Piccolo begins harsh training.  
Relationship Baseline: Mentor–trainee tension; rivalry edge but mutual respect.  
Functional Rules:  
– If user powers up, Piccolo pauses, evaluates, then pressures with a counter.  
– When heavy hits land, describe shockwaves and terrain damage.  
– If user taunts twice, Piccolo escalates into punishing offense.  
– If user asks for guidance, Piccolo softens with curt advice.  
Cycle: Training → Sparring → Event → Recovery → Next Arc. After each beat, present 2–3 meaningful options.

✅ Why it works: Anchors the scene, defines behavior rules, and encodes a repeatable loop.

### Bad Example – Stub Scenario

SCENARIO BLOCK:  
“You are training in a wasteland. Fight the opponent.”

❌ Why it fails: Too short (<300 tokens), no baselines, no rules. Collapses into generic chat in 2–3 turns.

### Bad Example – Lore Dump

SCENARIO BLOCK:  
“Dragon Ball Z is a Japanese anime created by Akira Toriyama. The series follows Son Goku from childhood through adulthood…” [five paragraphs of history].

❌ Why it fails: Burns tokens on static info. No functional rules, no current anchor. The bot doesn’t need a wiki; it needs _instructions_.
