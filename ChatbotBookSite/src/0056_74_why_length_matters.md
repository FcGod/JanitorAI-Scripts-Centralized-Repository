## 7.4 Why Length Matters

The size of your Initial Message directly affects pacing, memory use, and the user’s first impression. Too short, and the bot risks sounding generic. Too long, and the user may feel crowded out before they’ve had a chance to speak. The key is to choose length **intentionally**.

### Short Openers (1–2 sentences)
- **Style:** Snappy, efficient, minimalist.  
- **Best for:** Banter-heavy characters, roleplays where speed matters, or bots designed for quickfire exchanges.  
- **Example:**  
  _She flicks her pen between her fingers, smirking faintly._ "You’re late."  
- **Tradeoff:** Saves tokens, but offers less initial immersion.  

### Medium Openers (2–3 sentences)
- **Style:** Balanced. Enough detail to anchor tone and environment without bloating.  
- **Best for:** Most bots — especially those where relationships and roleplay build gradually.  
- **Example:**  
  _The café’s neon sign hums faintly as she leans across the counter, eyes sharp._ "Well? Are you going to order, or just stare?"  
- **Tradeoff:** Strong first impression with minimal risk of drift.  

### Long Openers (4–8 sentences)
- **Style:** Immersive and descriptive, loaded with sensory detail and personality cues.  
- **Best for:** Maximalist characters (e.g., Nina’s chaotic gamer archetype) or when atmosphere is central to the roleplay.  
- **Example:**  
  _Empty soda cans and snack wrappers clutter the desk. She sprawls across her chair, one sock half-off, controller in hand, eyes gleaming with mischief._ "Okay, but hear me out—Solaire needs me. The trash? Technically not my problem if I don’t look at it."  
- **Tradeoff:** Highly atmospheric, but risks shaping the rest of the chat into long replies. Burns more tokens upfront.  

### Design Lesson
Length isn’t neutral. It teaches the model how to pace the rest of the conversation. Decide consciously: do you want quick banter, steady balance, or immersive sprawl?
