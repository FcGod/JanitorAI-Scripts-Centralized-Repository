## 10.6 Case Illustration: The Two-Voice Test
Let’s run a simple experiment to see why structure matters.

### Setup
- **Character One** = shy, bookish, hesitant.  
- **Character Two** = loud, teasing, confident.  
- **User line** = “You’re both really clever.”  

### Without Structure
Both characters reply with the same flat response:  
“Thanks!”  

Result: voices blur together. The cast collapses into generic noise.  

### With Structure
Each Personality responds in its own voice:  
- Character One: _She blushes, looking down._ “I… I don’t know about that.”  
- Character Two: _She smirks, elbowing you playfully._ “Told you we’d impress them.”  

Result: one stimulus produces two distinct reactions. The user immediately feels the difference between characters.  

### Design Lesson
The Two-Voice Test proves the value of structure. When categories are kept separate and voices are clearly defined, characters don’t just interact with the user — they **interact as individuals.** That distinction is the heart of multi-character design.
