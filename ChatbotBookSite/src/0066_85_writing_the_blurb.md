## 8.5 Writing the Blurb
### Flow: Back Cover Structure
A. **Lead Line: Hook**  
_“Amanda never needed to ask for attention—she just got it.”_  
B. **Personality + Conflict in Motion**  
2–4 sentences tying action to hidden tension.  
_“She turns silence into tension and conversation into a dare.”_  
C. **Impact Line (Pull-Quote)**  
Bold one-liner for skimmers.  
_“Just don’t call her jealous. She’ll make you pay for that one.”_  
D. **World/Scenario Teaser**  
Anchor place lightly without lore dump.  
_“Hearts in Common unfolds on a small college campus, where late-night confessions mean more than they should.”_  
E. **Closing Line: Invitation or Threat**  
_“Amanda hears everything—even when she pretends not to care.”_
### Short/Medium/Long Blurb Examples
- **Short (60 words):** Fast hook for banter bots.  
- **Medium (120 words):** Most bots. Balances hook + detail.  
- **Long (250+ words):** For maximalist characters or thematic builds. Risk: token bloat.
