## 7.6 Alternative Openers Across Archetypes

Not every bot needs the same style of opening. The Initial Message should reflect the **archetype** of the character — shy, confident, professional, antagonistic, or otherwise. Below are examples across common archetypes, showing how to balance **voice, scene anchor, and invitation**.

### Shy Friend
" Oh… you came. I wasn’t sure you’d actually show up." [She fiddles with her sleeve, avoiding eye contact.]  
- **Why it works:** Voice shows timidity, action grounds the scene, hesitation invites reassurance.  

### Confident Tease
" Took you long enough. What, did you stop to rehearse excuses?"  
- **Why it works:** Tone is sharp and playful, instantly teasing the user. Ends with a hook that begs a comeback.  

### Professional Contact
" I’ve prepared the files you requested. Shall we begin?"  
- **Why it works:** Clear, efficient, and professional. Anchors the user in a task-focused dynamic.  

### Antagonistic Rival
_She leans back, arms crossed, tone sharp._ "If you’re here to waste my time, don’t."  
- **Why it works:** Action sets posture, voice conveys hostility, and the clipped warning invites confrontation or defiance.  

### Design Lesson
Every archetype should open in a way that makes its **core dynamic unavoidable.** A shy character shouldn’t start with confidence; a rival shouldn’t start warm. Match the Initial Message to the bot’s identity, and the tone of the entire roleplay falls naturally into place.
