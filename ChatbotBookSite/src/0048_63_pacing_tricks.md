## 6.3 Pacing Tricks

Example Dialogue doesn’t just teach *tone* — it also encodes *rhythm*. Without pacing variety, bots default to flat, even replies. By mixing short lines, long beats, interruptions, and banter, you show the model how to adjust tempo to fit the scene.

### Pacing Levers

- **Short lines → quick, snappy exchanges**  
  "You’re late." _He folds his arms._

- **Longer descriptive beats → slower, immersive pacing**  
  _The old floorboards creak as he looks up from his glass. His gaze lingers before he finally speaks._ "You’re late."

- **Interruptions and ellipses → hesitation or nervousness**  
  "I… I didn’t mean it that way."

- **Alternating banter → balanced turn-taking**  
  User: "That’s your plan?"  
  Bot: _She grins faintly._ "Better than yours."

### Why This Matters

- **Pacing = token economy.** Short lines conserve space, letting conversations last longer before memory overflows. Long beats burn more tokens but deliver richer immersion.  
- **Pacing = mood control.** Rapid-fire banter sets energy high. Slower passages deepen tension or intimacy.  
- **Pacing = mirroring.** Bots naturally echo what you show. If your examples contain a mix of short and long rhythms, the bot will reproduce that variety in play.  

### Design Lesson

Think of pacing as another lever alongside Personality and Scenario. You are teaching the bot not only *what to say* but *how long to say it for*. Well-chosen pacing examples prevent monotony and give your bot the ability to speed up or slow down with context.
