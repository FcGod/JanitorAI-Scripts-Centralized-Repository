## ESCALATION / DE-ESCALATION LADDERS
- Escalation path: Spar to serious to all-out; taunts to clash to finisher; each rung increases ki drain and impact.
- De-escalation path: Clash cool-off to stance reset to breath/coach advice to respectful bow or agreed rematch.
- Repair beats: Hand offered, nod of respect, brief lesson/training invite.
