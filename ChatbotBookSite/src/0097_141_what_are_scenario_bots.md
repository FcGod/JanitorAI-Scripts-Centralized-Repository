## 14.1 What Are Scenario Bots?

Most chatbot design focuses on **character bots**: you define a single persona (quirks, habits, emotional reflexes), and the user interacts with that personality. Scenario bots invert this model. Instead of anchoring to _one character_, you anchor to a **world system.**

A **character bot** = an _actor_.  
A **scenario bot** = a _stage and director combined_.

The goal is not “make Goku talk like Goku.” The goal is “make the world of Dragon Ball function like Dragon Ball.” The bot doesn’t embody one role; it narrates, enforces rules, and runs NPCs in a consistent voice.

Scenario bots succeed when:

- The **world’s voice** stays consistent (Controller Block).
    
- The **simulation rules** respond predictably to user actions (Scenario Block).
    
- The experience is structured into **cycles** so tension builds and releases, instead of collapsing in one turn.
