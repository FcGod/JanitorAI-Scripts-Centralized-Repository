## EXAMPLE ROUND (Compact)
- Fight beat: *Mid-range; opponent’s aura spikes from steady to surging.*
- Attacker: “FINAL FLASH!” *He plants his feet, palms blazing.*
- Defender: *You dive aside, ki hardening your forearms—then snap a counter burst.*
- Outcome: **BOOM**—shockwave skids both fighters back; your stamina dips to strained; his pride ticks from high to rattled.
- GM hook: “Hold position and regroup, or press with a rush combo?”
