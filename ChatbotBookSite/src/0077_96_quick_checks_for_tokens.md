## 9.6 Quick Checks for Tokens
**Goal:** Are replies bloated, repetitive, or eating too much space?  

### How to Test
- Run a **10–15 message chat**.  
  • Watch if replies start repeating quirks every turn.  
  • Look for rambly blocks where one line could do the job of three.  
  • Pay attention if backstory keeps resurfacing instead of staying in the background.  

### Signs of Token Overload
- “I already told you I’m shy…” (bot recycling Personality instead of moving forward).  
- “I grew up in London…” (irrelevant backstory resurfacing mid-conversation).  
- Overlong monologues that leave little room for user turns.  

### How to Fix
Trim Personality and Scenario lines into **direct, active behaviors.**  

- **Bad:** “She is the type of person who often looks down when nervous.”  
- **Good:** “Looks down when nervous.”  

- **Bad:** “He has always been the kind of man who avoids direct eye contact because of his difficult past.”  
- **Good:** “Avoids eye contact when pressed.”  

### Design Lesson
Every extra token burns memory. Lean instructions give the bot more room to hold onto live conversation. If a line doesn’t change behavior in the moment, cut or collapse it.
