## 15.8 Conclusion

Scenario bots are more than a gimmick. They are **world simulators**: compact systems that make environments interactive and alive.

Chapter 14 showed how to anchor them: Controller for style, Scenario for rules.  
Chapter 15 has given you advanced tools: alternative genre case studies, pitfalls, skeletons, and testing workflows.

Together, these two chapters consolidate everything from the Scenario Bot Guide into a repeatable method. Scenario bots now stand alongside character and multi-character bots as a **third major design path** in your toolbox.
