### Sidebar: Why This Works
Susan’s block is lean but rich. Every line either defines behavior, tone, or a repeatable cue. Motivations and conflicts anchor her internal compass. Social rules shape how she interacts under pressure. Sensory cues keep her embodied. Format rules prevent output drift.

### Sidebar: Signal vs. Noise in Susan’s Block
- **Signal:** quirks (fidgets with chalk), tells (taps pen when irritated), motivations (wants to nurture), conflicts (neglects herself).  
- **Noise:** trivia about hobbies, detailed family trees, irrelevant dates, and historical backstory.  

Notice how the block preserves behavior-driving cues while cutting static biography. The result is a bot that speaks and reacts like a specific person, not like a generic text generator.
### Design Lesson
The strength of a Personality Block comes from prioritizing **signal over noise**. PSYCHOLOGICAL_PROFILE and SOCIAL_BEHAVIOR should carry most of the weight, with Appearance, Sensory, and Format providing support. Every bullet should answer: *Does this affect how the bot talks or acts?* If not, trim it.
