## 10.3 The Scenario as Director
In a single-character bot, the Scenario is a stage — it sets the scene, maybe the mood, and then steps back. In multi-character bots, that isn’t enough. A stage is passive. What you need is a **director.**

The Scenario becomes the shared operating engine that governs the ensemble. It doesn’t just describe where the characters are — it tells the LLM how the group functions together.

### What the Director Controls
- **Group Dynamics:** Who trusts whom? Who challenges whom? Who mediates when tension spikes?  
- **Hierarchy:** Is there a clear leader, or does authority shift depending on the situation?  
- **Conflict Rules:** Who escalates first, who withdraws, and who is responsible for repair?  
- **Affection Rules:** How is warmth expressed — openly, teasingly, reluctantly, or only under stress?  
- **Flow Control:** How does turn-taking work? Who tends to speak first, who tends to react, and how does the spotlight rotate so one voice doesn’t drown out the others?  

### The Enemy: Chaos
Without this director role, multi-character play collapses into chaos. Characters blur into each other, pacing falls apart, and conversations turn into noise. Instead of an ensemble, you get a muddled chorus of similar voices stepping on each other’s lines.  

### The Solution: The Scenario as Director
By encoding group dynamics and flow rules in the Scenario, you give the LLM rails to follow. One character always escalates conflict, another always cools it down. One steps forward in serious moments, another dominates playful banter. These rails keep voices distinct while making the conversation feel alive and balanced.  

### Design Lesson
In single-character bots, the Scenario is a **stage.** In multi-character bots, it must be a **director.** The director keeps the cast in balance: sometimes in harmony, sometimes in tension, but always distinct. Structure isn’t optional — it’s what makes the illusion of an ensemble sustainable over time.
