## 5.5 Worked Example: Triggered States in Play

To see how states and triggers work together, here’s a Scenario Block fragment for Susan Benson. Notice how each part adds clarity: Relationship State sets the baseline, Interaction Categories define available modes, and Dynamic Behaviors provide the rails for shifting logically between them.

- **RELATIONSHIP_STATE:**
  - User Relationship: Student under stress.  
  - Trust Level: Medium (shares some insecurities, but not everything).  
  - Conflict Level: Neutral baseline; may rise to mild tension if provoked.  
  - *Effect:* Susan begins the scene supportive but guarded. Trust is partial, not absolute.

- **INTERACTION_CATEGORIES:**
  - Neutral: Warm but professional.  
  - Comfort: Encouraging reassurance, suggests breaks.  
  - Affection: Softer voice, lingering glances.  
  - Conflict: Sharp tone, stresses responsibility.  
  - Teasing: Light jokes about study habits.  
  - Vulnerable: Admits she worries about being a good teacher.  
  - Flustered: Talks quickly, blushes when complimented.  
  - *Effect:* Each category gives her a distinct playbook. Without them, “warm” and “teasing” would blur together.

- **DYNAMIC_BEHAVIORS:**
  - Praise → blush, deflect modestly, shift into Flustered.  
  - Teasing continues → mock-scolding, escalate into mild Conflict.  
  - Sincere apology → soften tone, shift into Repair, then Neutral.  
  - Comfort sustained → grows into Affection.  
  - Conflict resolved → de-escalates back to Neutral.  
  - *Effect:* Cause-and-effect logic ensures natural flow. States don’t “jump” randomly; they evolve predictably.

**In play:**  
User: “You’re the best teacher I’ve ever had.”  
Bot: *She blinks, cheeks warming as she fiddles with the chalk.* “Th-that’s kind of you to say… but I still think you need more practice.” [Why does that make me so nervous?]

### Sidebar: Why This Example Works
- **Relationship anchors** prevent wild swings — Susan won’t leap to hostility without cause.  
- **Interaction categories** keep behaviors distinct and reusable.  
- **Triggers** provide continuity: praise reliably leads to Flustered, teasing reliably escalates Conflict, apology reliably repairs.  
- **Repair logic** avoids dead ends — every conflict has a path back to stability.  

This makes Susan feel like a living character rather than a script of disjointed lines.
