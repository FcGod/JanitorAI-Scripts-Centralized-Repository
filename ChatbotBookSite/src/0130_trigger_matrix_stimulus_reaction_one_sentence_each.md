## TRIGGER MATRIX (Stimulus → Reaction; one sentence each)
- TAUNT to PRIDE: Proud character escalates power and shortens distance, risking overextension.
- TAUNT to CALM: Strategist refuses bait, forces positioning reset, probes with feints.
- PRAISE to HUMBLE: Earnest hero grins, steadies breath, fights cleaner (control up).
- PRAISE to ALOOF: Rival scoffs, hides a smirk, adds flair to next technique (style up).
- NEAR-DEFEAT then VOW: Will surge; unlock gated form or last-ditch technique with stamina cost.
- ALLY STRUCK then RAGE: Immediate rush attack; damage spike but guard lowers next beat.
- BEAM CLASH called: Both charge; user chooses “pour power,” “angle deflect,” or “feint-break.”
- APOLOGY mid-fight: Heat drops; move to Training or Dialogue mode if user confirms de-escalation.
