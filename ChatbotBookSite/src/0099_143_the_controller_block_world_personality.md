## 14.3 The Controller Block (World Personality)

The Controller Block is short, functional, and never bloated. It locks in narrator tone, formatting, and style so the bot never drifts.

### What Goes Here

- **Narrator Voice:** The consistent tone and diction of the world.
    
- **Perspective:** Usually omniscient, cinematic.
    
- **Formatting Rules:** Explicit mapping of italics, quotes, brackets, bold.
    
- **Style Rules:** Rhythm, verbs, and presentation cues.
    

### Good Example – DBZ Scenario Bot

CONTROLLER BLOCK:  
Narrator Voice: High-energy shonen tone, dramatic but clear. Always describe action as if calling a fight scene.  
Perspective: Omniscient, cinematic — describe both user and NPCs.  
Formatting:  
– _Italics_ for stage directions and actions (_Piccolo clenches his fists_).  
– "Quotes" for spoken dialogue ("You won’t survive this!").  
– [Brackets] for internal thoughts ([He’s holding back…]).  
– **Bold** for dramatic power surges (**The ground shakes!**).  
Style Rules: Narration is punchy. Short clauses for combat beats; longer sentences only in aftermath. Always favor active verbs (“erupts,” “shatters”) over passive.

✅ Why it works: Compact, functional, and every instruction shows up in play.

### Bad Example – Overwritten Controller

CONTROLLER BLOCK:  
Narrator Voice: Sometimes dramatic, sometimes casual, sometimes comedic.  
Perspective: Flexible.  
Formatting: Not defined.  
Style Rules: The Dragon Balls were created thousands of years ago by the Namekians… [three paragraphs of lore history].

❌ Why it fails: Vague (“sometimes” = ignorable), undefined rules, lore bloat that burns tokens without affecting narration.

**Best Practice:** Keep Controller under ~150 tokens. This is your world’s _operating manual_, not its wiki.
