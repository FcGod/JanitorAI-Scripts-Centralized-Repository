## 7.7 Practical Design Tips

Crafting strong Initial Messages isn’t about writing flowery prose — it’s about designing a **first beat of play** that locks in character, scene, and rhythm. Here are practical guidelines:

### Write in Live Voice
Don’t summarize who the character is (“She is a shy girl who likes books”). Perform it in the moment. Let quirks, hesitations, or sharpness show through in the way they act and speak.

### End With a Choice
The opener should hand control back to the user. A question, a playful jab, or a dangling comment keeps the exchange alive.  
- Weak: _She smiles at you._  
- Strong: _She smiles faintly, eyes flicking away._ "So… are you going to sit, or just stand there?"

### Match Scenario Mood
If the Scenario says “strained,” the opener must carry tension. If it says “playful,” the opener should tease. Personality anchors identity, Scenario anchors situation, and the Initial Message should **echo both**.

### Tune Length to Intent
Decide deliberately: banter bots thrive on 1–2 sentence hooks, balanced builds on 2–3 sentences, and maximalist characters may justify 5–8 immersive sentences. Don’t let length drift by accident — make it a design choice.

### Use Anchors That Recycle
Props, gestures, and sensory cues in the opener can be reused later. If the opener mentions a half-empty coffee mug or a neon sign buzzing overhead, the bot is more likely to reference them again, strengthening immersion.

### Test and Iterate
Run your opener in live chat. If user responses feel flat, adjust pacing, add an invitation, or sharpen tone. Treat the Initial Message as a prototype, not a final draft.

### Design Lesson
The Initial Message is not biography. It’s not a paragraph of lore. It’s the **first move in a dialogue.** Write it as if the curtain has just gone up — action, voice, and an invitation for the user to step in.
