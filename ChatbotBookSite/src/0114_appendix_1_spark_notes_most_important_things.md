# Appendix 1 – Spark Notes / Most Important Things

### Token Rules
- Keep permanent tokens under ~2,000 (Personality + Scenario + Example Dialogue).
- Personality per character: 300–500 tokens.
- Always trim prose and biography; focus on active behaviors.
- Remember: every symbol, formatting mark, and emoji also burns tokens.

### Personality vs Scenario vs Dialogue
- **Personality = Identity** → who they always are, quirks, voice, reflexes.
- **Scenario = Script** → how they act *right now*, state, tone, triggers.
- **Dialogue = Performance** → how they actually sound in play.

### U-Curve Memory
- Start = strong anchor (Personality).
- End = strong recency driver (Scenario + Example Dialogue).
- Middle = weakest zone (avoid burying rules here).

### Trigger Basics
- Praise to Fluster or Deflect.
- Tease to Pushback or Conflict.
- Apology to Repair.
- Comfort to Affection.
- Triggers must be crisp cause-to-effect, no “might” or “sometimes.”

### Multi-Character Rules
- Separate Personality blocks for each character, same category order.
- Contrast is king: no two should react identically to the same cue.
- Scenario becomes the director: manages trust, conflict, affection, and pacing.
- Enforce turn-taking: one reacts first, the other contrasts or comments.

### Formatting Keys
- _Italics = actions_  
- “Quotes = dialogue”  
- [Brackets = thoughts]  
- **Bold = emphasis**  
- (Parentheses = OOC)

### Testing Cheats
- Run at least 10 lines — does the voice hold or drift?
- Stress test with tease, apology, silence, long messages.
- Watch for repetition (“I already told you…”) = too much Personality weight.
- Fix one thing at a time: Personality, Scenario, or Example Dialogue.
