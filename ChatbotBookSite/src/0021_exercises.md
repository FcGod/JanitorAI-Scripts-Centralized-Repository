## Exercises

**1. Token Counter Drill**  
Write a 200-word Personality draft. Run it through a token counter. Now trim it to 120 words without losing meaning. Count tokens again. How much did you save?

**2. Collapse Practice**  
Take three sentences of backstory. Rewrite them into one line that focuses on behavior instead of history.

**3. Reply Pacing Test**  
Start a chat with your bot using one short sentence as your opener. Then restart the chat with a long, descriptive opener. Compare the bot’s reply length. How does your opener shape its pacing?

**4. Token Audit**  
Paste your Personality + Scenario into a token counter. Is it under 1,800 tokens? If not, trim. That space is conversation you’re losing.

✅ End of Chapter 2. With token efficiency, you now know how to trim, collapse, and guide pacing. In Chapter 3, we’ll build the **Personality Block** — the character’s DNA — using these efficiency principles to keep it lean and functional.
