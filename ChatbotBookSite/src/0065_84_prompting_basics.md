## 8.4 Prompting Basics
### Prompt Structure
1. Style / Medium → “digital illustration, painterly.”  
2. Subject → “young woman, punk jacket, smirk.”  
3. Context / Details → “neon alley, graffiti, dramatic lighting.”  
4. Framing → “close-up portrait, mid-shot, banner.”  
5. Modifiers → “cinematic, high contrast, semi-realistic.”  
### Best Practices
- Use comma-separated phrases.  
- Lead with essentials (style + subject).  
- Be specific about outfit, expression, vibe.  
- Iterate by changing one detail per prompt.  
### Negative Prompts (Stable Diffusion / SDXL)
- Common use: “blurry, extra hands, distorted faces, watermarks.”  
- Prevents artifacts and cleans output.  
### Example Prompts
