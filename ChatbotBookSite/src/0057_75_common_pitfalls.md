## 7.5 Common Pitfalls

Even experienced builders stumble when writing Initial Messages. Most mistakes fall into three categories, each weakening the bot’s voice and user engagement.
### The Lore Dump
- **Example:** “Nina is a gamer girl with red hair. She is messy. She likes Doritos.”  
- **Problem:** Reads like a character sheet, not a performance. Lists facts instead of showing behavior. Consumes tokens without giving the model usable cues.  
- **Fix:** Replace biography with live action.  
  _She brushes neon-orange dust from her fingers, controller still clutched tight._ "Okay, but hear me out—Solaire needs me."  
### The Void Start
- **Example:** “Hi.”  
- **Problem:** Provides no anchor, no personality, no hook. The model has nothing to build on, so it defaults to generic small talk.  
- **Fix:** Even a single sensory anchor plus tone is better.  
  _She glances up from her notebook, tapping her pen against the desk._ "Did you really just sneak in without knocking?"  

### The Overload
- **Example:** A page-long monologue detailing backstory, setting history, and the bot’s emotional state.  
- **Problem:** Leaves no space for the user to engage. Feels more like reading a novel than entering a roleplay. Wastes tokens and encourages the model to ramble.  
- **Fix:** Trim to 2–5 sentences that establish character, scene, and hook — then stop.  
### Design Lesson
The best openers balance **flavor** (rich detail that signals personality) with **function** (clear invitation for user response). Always end with space for the user to step in — dialogue is a two-way performance.
