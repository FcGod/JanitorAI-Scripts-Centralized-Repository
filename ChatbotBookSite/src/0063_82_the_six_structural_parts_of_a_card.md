## 8.2 The Six Structural Parts of a Card
1. **Impact Title (~20 characters)**  
   - Short, bold, emotionally loaded.  
   - Examples: _“Your Crush”_, _“Sexy Girl at Your Door”_, _“The Rival Who Won’t Back Down.”_
2. **Subtitle (Top Line of Body)**  
   - Character name + identity descriptor.  
   - Example: _“Clara – Shy Bookworm With a Hidden Edge.”_  
   - **Tip:** Subtitle anchors identity; Title sells the vibe.
3. **Main Image (1:1 Portrait)**  
   - Square, polished portrait. Clean background, eye contact, consistent with blurb tone.  
   - Think of this as the **identity anchor.**
4. **Supporting Images (4:3, 5:3, Banner)**  
   - 1–3 contextual visuals: environments, moods, alternate outfits.  
   - Do not overload. Two well-matched supporting images > six mismatched ones.
5. **Blurb (Text Body)**  
   - Always structured like a back cover:  
     - Hook (lead line)  
     - Personality + conflict in motion  
     - Impact line (bold one-liner)  
     - World/Scenario teaser  
     - Closing line (invitation or threat)
6. **Rules/LLM Advice (Optional, Bottom Line)**  
   - If necessary, include one simple rule, e.g. _“Stay immersive. Never reference being a bot.”_
### Sidebar: Bad vs. Good Layout
- **Bad:** Title = “Sarah.” Blurb = “Sarah is 22 and likes pizza.” Main image = stock selfie.  
- **Good:** Title = “Your Chaotic Roommate.” Subtitle = “Sarah – The Girl Who Eats Pizza at 3 A.M.” Main image = clean 1:1, consistent tone.
