## 8.1 Why Bot Cards Matter
The bot card is your **storefront window.** Before a user ever sees your carefully built Personality or Scenario, they see the card. This is the **first impression**, and it often determines whether they click or scroll past.
A strong card:  
- **Grabs attention** with a sharp title and evocative visuals.  
- **Hooks emotion** with a blurb that reads like the back cover of a novel.  
- **Sets expectations** for tone and play style immediately.  
A weak card:  
- Reads like a résumé.  
- Uses mismatched or bland visuals.  
- Buries the hook under fluff or lore dumps.  
**Why this matters:** No matter how polished your internal design is, a weak storefront means fewer users will ever experience it. Presentation sells the click.

| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Title: “Your Crush” → emotional hook                                  | Title: “Anna Johnson” → bland, no hook                     |
| Subtitle: “Clara – Shy Bookworm With a Hidden Edge” → identity anchor | Subtitle: “Clara, Female, Age 22” → reads like census data |
| Portrait: Clean, face-forward, consistent style                       | Portrait: Cropped, blurry, mismatched styles               |
| Blurb: Hooks, conflict, impact line, world tease                      | Blurb: Lore dump or dry biography                          |
| Close: Invitation or threat → gives user way in                       | Close: Neutral fact → no call to engage                    |
