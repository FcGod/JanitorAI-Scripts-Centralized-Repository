## 9.7 Pitfalls in Debugging
Even careful testing can go wrong if you fall into these traps:

### Over-editing
You trim so much Personality and Scenario detail that the bot feels hollow.  
- Symptom: The bot answers generically, with no quirks or habits left.  
- Fix: Keep at least one anchor in each category (quirk, social cue, sensory).

### Whack-a-Mole Fixing
You patch one issue, create another.  
- Symptom: Fixing “too flirty” turns into “now flat and cold.”  
- Fix: Change one thing at a time. Re-test with the same user input to confirm.

### Casual Testing
You chat for fun instead of stress-testing.  
- Symptom: Problems don’t show up until later, because you never pushed the design.  
- Fix: Always try extremes — teasing, conflict, praise, silence — not just friendly small talk.

### Chasing Perfection
You keep editing forever, looking for a flawless run.  
- Symptom: The bot feels good, but you keep tinkering anyway.  
- Fix: Remember: bots don’t need perfection. They need to be consistent enough for enjoyable play.

### Ignoring Token Bloat
You polish tone but leave Personality and Scenario too long.  
- Symptom: The bot repeats itself or forgets live chat too quickly.  
- Fix: Run a token counter and trim until permanent blocks leave room for conversation.

**Design lesson:** Debugging isn’t about making the bot perfect — it’s about making it reliable. Once the bot consistently shows tone, triggers, and quirks under stress, it’s production-ready.
