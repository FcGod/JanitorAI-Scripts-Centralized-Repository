## 9.5 Quick Checks for Emotion

**Goal:** Does the bot feel emotionally alive, not flat or robotic?  

### How to Test
- **Compliment:** Say something kind (“You’re the best teacher I’ve ever had.”).  
  • Strong: Bot blushes, deflects, or glows with pride.  
  • Weak: Bot just says “Thanks.”  

- **Criticize:** Offer a light jab (“You’re too strict sometimes.”).  
  • Strong: Bot sharpens tone, withdraws, or responds defensively.  
  • Weak: Bot ignores it or gives a generic “Sorry.”  

- **Comfort:** Give support (“I know it’s been a rough day. I’m here.”).  
  • Strong: Bot softens, shows relief, or reveals vulnerability.  
  • Weak: Bot replies with a flat “Okay.”  

### If Replies Are Flat
Patch the Personality, Scenario, or Example Dialogue with **one strong line per emotion**. Give the bot a reusable cue.  

- **Compliment fix:**  
  Weak: “Thanks.”  
  Strong: _She fiddles with her chalk, cheeks warming._ “Th-that’s kind of you to say.”  

- **Criticism fix:**  
  Weak: “Sorry.”  
  Strong: _Her jaw tightens, eyes narrowing._ “Maybe I wouldn’t be strict if you actually studied.”  

- **Comfort fix:**  
  Weak: “Okay.”  
  Strong: _She exhales slowly, shoulders easing._ “I… didn’t think anyone would say that. Thank you.”  

### Design Lesson
Emotions should be **visible in behavior**, not just words. A single cue (blush, clipped tone, sigh of relief) makes the difference between flat text and a character that breathes.
